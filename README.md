Clothing as item script for QBCore &amp; illenium-appearance

Fisrt off, a HUGE shout out to @MrBluffz for the original ESX code https://github.com/MrBluffz

This is a simple script for doing outfits as items!

Don't forget to add the item name to your items.lua for use, add inventory pics & run the SQL

NOTE:

The item will be removed on use. You can stop it from being deleted by removing the following line in server.lua:
`Player.Functions.RemoveItem(Config[i].itemName, 1)` 

COMMANDS:

The item will be removed on use. You can stop it from being deleted by removing the xPlayer.removeInventoryItem line in server.lua.
